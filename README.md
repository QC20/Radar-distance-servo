# Arduino Radar Sensor

This code implements an Arduino program that uses a radar sensor to detect objects and visualize their distance and angle on a graphical interface. The code reads data from the radar sensor and displays it on a screen, allowing you to visualize the position of detected objects in real-time.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need the following:

- Arduino board or compatible clone
- Radar sensor connected to the Arduino board
- Processing software installed on your computer

## Circuit Setup

Connect the radar sensor to your Arduino board according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ensure that the radar sensor is properly powered and connected to the correct pins on the Arduino board.

## Code Explanation

The code uses the Processing library to create a graphical interface and display the radar data. It communicates with the Arduino board via the serial port to receive the sensor data.

The Arduino code initializes the serial communication and reads the sensor data, which consists of the angle and distance of detected objects. The data is then sent to the Processing software for visualization.

The Processing code draws a radar-like interface using arcs and lines. It translates the received angle and distance data into coordinates on the screen and draws lines to represent the detected objects. The distance values are used to control the length of the lines, while the angle values determine their direction.

The code also displays text information, such as the angle and distance of the detected objects, and provides visual cues for different distance ranges.

## Getting Started

To use this code:

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. Open the Arduino IDE or compatible development environment.
3. Upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.
4. Disconnect the Arduino board from the computer.
5. Open the Processing software on your computer.
6. Open the provided code in the Processing software.
7. Modify the serial port name in the line `myPort = new Serial(this,"dev/cu.usbmodem1412401", 9600);` to match the port name of your Arduino board.
8. Run the Processing code.
9. The radar interface should appear on the screen, displaying any detected objects.

## Customize the Code

You can customize the code to adapt it to your specific needs:

- Adjust the size of the radar interface by modifying the `size()` function parameters in the `setup()` function.
- Modify the colors used for drawing the radar and objects by changing the values in the `fill()` and `stroke()` functions.
- Customize the text displayed on the screen by modifying the text strings and positions in the `drawText()` function.
- Experiment with different visual representations for the detected objects by modifying the drawing functions, such as `drawObject()` and `drawLine()`.
